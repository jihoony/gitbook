# Calculate Cpu Usage on Linux as Top

## Calculate Cpu Usage on Linux as Top



`man ps` in `NOTES` section.

```
   CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running
   during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal, and it does not
   conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to.  CPU usage is
   unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.
```

And, guess you know, but you can also do:

```
top -p <PID>
```

**Edit**: as to your comment on other answer;

Short answer: you can't.

### Why is it so?

It is like asking someone to calculate the speed of a car from a picture.

While `top` is a monitoring tool, `ps` is a snapshot tool. Think of it like this: _At any given moment a process either uses the CPU or not. Thus you have either 0% or 100% load in that exact moment._

Giving: If `ps` should give _instant CPU usage_ it would be either 0% or 100%.

`top` on the other hand keep polling numbers and calculate load over time.

`ps` could have given current usage â€“ but that would require it to read data multiple times and sleep between each read. It doesn't.

### Calculation for ps %cpu

`ps` calculates CPU usage in the following manner:

```
uptime  = total time system has been running.
ps_time = process start time measured in seconds from boot.
pu_time = total time process has been using the CPU.

;; Seconds process has been running:
seconds   = uptime - ps_time
;; Usage:
cpu_usage = pu_time * 1000 / seconds

print: cpu_usage / 10 "." cpu_usage % 10

Example:

uptime  = 344,545
ps_time = 322,462
pu_time =   3,383

seconds   = 344,545 - 322,462 = 22,083
cpu_usage = 3,383 * 1,000 / 22,083 = 153

print: 153 / 10 "." 153 % 10 => 15.3

```

So the number printed is: time the process has been using the CPU during it's lifetime. As in the example above. It has done so in 15.3% of its lifetime. In 84,7% of the time it has not been bugging on the CPU.

### Data retrieval

`ps`, as well as `top`, uses data from files stored under `/proc/` - or the [process information pseudo-file system](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man5/proc.5.html).

You have some files in root of `/proc/` that have various information about the overall state of the system. In addition each process has its own sub folder `/proc/<PID>/` where process specific data is stored. So, for example the process from your question had a folder at `/proc/3038/`.

When `ps` calculates CPU usage it uses two files:

```
/proc/uptime      The uptime of the system (seconds), and the amount of time spent in idle process (seconds).
/proc/[PID]/stat  Status information about the process.
```

* From `uptime` it uses the first value (_uptime_).&#x20;
* From `[PID]/stat` it uses the following:

```
 #  Name      Description
14  utime     CPU time spent in user code, measured in jiffies
15  stime     CPU time spent in kernel code, measured in jiffies
16  cutime    CPU time spent in user code, including time from children
17  cstime    CPU time spent in kernel code, including time from children 
22  starttime Time when the process started, measured in jiffies
```

A _jiffie_ is clock tick. So in addition it uses various methods, ie., `sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)`, to get system's Hertz (number of ticks per second) - ultimately using 100 as a fall-back after exhausting other options.

So if `utime` is 1234 and Hertz is 100 then:

```
seconds = utime / Hertz = 1234 / 100 = 12.34
```

The actual calculation is done by:

```
total_time = utime + stime

IF include_dead_children
    total_time = total_time + cutime + cstime
ENDIF

seconds = uptime - starttime / Hertz

pcpu = (total_time * 1000 / Hertz) / seconds

print: "%CPU" pcpu / 10 "." pcpu % 10
```

Example (Output from a custom Bash script):

```
$ ./psw2 30894
System information
           uptime : 353,512 seconds
             idle : 0
Process information
              PID : 30894
         filename : plugin-containe
            utime : 421,951 jiffies 4,219 seconds
            stime : 63,334 jiffies 633 seconds
           cutime : 0 jiffies 0 seconds
           cstime : 1 jiffies 0 seconds
        starttime : 32,246,240 jiffies 322,462 seconds

Process run time  : 31,050
Process CPU time  : 485,286 jiffies 4,852 seconds
CPU usage since birth: 15.6%
```

### Calculating _"current"_ load with ps

This is a (bit?) shady endeavour but OK. Lets have a go.

One could use times provided by `ps` and calculate CPU usage from this. When thinking about it it could actually be rather useful, with some limitations.

This could be useful to calculate CPU usage over a longer period. I.e. say you want to monitor the average CPU load of `plugin-container` in Firefox while doing some Firefox-related task.

By using output from:

$ ps -p -o cputime,etimes

```
CODE    HEADER   DESCRIPTION
cputime TIME     cumulative CPU time, "[DD-]hh:mm:ss" format.  (alias time).
etime   ELAPSED  elapsed time since the process was started, [DD-]hh:]mm:ss.
etimes  ELAPSED  elapsed time since the process was started, in seconds.
```

I use `etime` over `etimes` in this sample, on calculations, only to be a bit more clear. Also I add %cpu for "fun". In i.e. a bash script one would obviously use `etimes` - or better read from `/proc/<PID>/` etc.

```
Start:
$ ps -p 30894 -o %cpu,cputime,etime,etimes
%CPU     TIME     ELAPSED ELAPSED
 5.9 00:13:55    03:53:56   14036

End:
%CPU     TIME     ELAPSED ELAPSED
 6.2 00:14:45    03:56:07   14167

Calculate times:
            13 * 60 + 55 =    835   (cputime this far)
3 * 3,600 + 53 * 60 + 56 = 14,036   (time running this far)

            14 * 60 + 45 =    885   (cputime at end)
3 * 3,600 + 56 * 60 +  7 = 14,167   (time running at end)

Calculate percent load:
((885 - 835) / (14,167 - 14,036)) * 100 = 38
```

Process was using the CPU 38% of the time during this period.

### Look at the code

If you want to know how `ps` does it, and know a little C, do (looks like you run Gnome Debain deriavnt) - nice attitude in the code regarding comments etc.:

```
apt-get source procps
cd procps*/ps
vim HACKING
```



## Implementation

### Preparation

To calculate CPU usage for a specific process you'll need the following:

1. [`/proc/uptime`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html)
   * `#1` uptime of the system (seconds)
2. [`/proc/[PID]/stat`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html)
   * `#14` `utime` - CPU time spent in user code, measured in _clock ticks_
   * `#15` `stime` - CPU time spent in kernel code, measured in _clock ticks_
   * `#16` `cutime` - **Waited-for children's** CPU time spent in user code (in _clock ticks_)
   * `#17` `cstime` - **Waited-for children's** CPU time spent in kernel code (in _clock ticks_)
   * `#22` `starttime` - Time when the process started, measured in _clock ticks_
3. Hertz (number of clock ticks per second) of your system.
   * In most cases, [`getconf CLK_TCK`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/getconf.html) can be used to return the number of clock ticks.
   * The [`sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/sysconf.html) C function call may also be used to return the hertz value.



### Calculation

First we determine the total time spent for the process:

```
total_time = utime + stime
```

We also have to decide whether we want to include the time from children processes. If we do, then we add those values to `total_time`:

```
total_time = total_time + cutime + cstime
```

Next we get the total elapsed time in _seconds_ since the process started:

```
seconds = uptime - (starttime / Hertz)
```

Finally we calculate the CPU usage percentage:

```
cpu_usage = 100 * ((total_time / Hertz) / seconds)
```



### Sample Code on Cpp

```cpp
void resource_usage(double& vm_usage, double& resident_set, double& cpus) {
    // memory
    vm_usage = 0.0;
    resident_set = 0.0;

    std::ifstream stat_stream("/proc/self/stat", std::ios_base::in); //get info from proc directory

    //create some variables to get info
    std::string pid, comm, state, ppid, pgrp, session, tty_nr;
    std::string tpgid, flags, minflt, cminflt, majflt, cmajflt;
    unsigned long utime, stime, cutime, cstime, priority, nice;
    unsigned long num_threads, itrealvalue, starttime;
    unsigned long vsize;
    long rss;

    stat_stream >> pid >> comm >> state >> ppid >> pgrp >> session >> tty_nr
                >> tpgid >> flags >> minflt >> cminflt >> majflt >> cmajflt
                >> utime >> stime >> cutime >> cstime >> priority >> nice
                >> num_threads >> itrealvalue >> starttime >> vsize >> rss; // don't care about the rest

    stat_stream.close();

    long page_size_kb = sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE) / 1024; // for x86-64 is configured to use 2MB pages

    vm_usage = vsize / 1024.0;
    resident_set = rss * page_size_kb;

    // cpus
    std::ifstream uptime_stream("/proc/uptime", std::ios_base::in);

    unsigned long uptime;
    uptime_stream >> uptime;
    uptime_stream.close();

    unsigned long total_time = utime + stime;
    total_time = total_time + cutime + cstime;

    long Hertz = sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);
    unsigned long seconds = uptime - (starttime / Hertz);
    
    double cpu_usage = 100 * (((double)total_time / Hertz) / seconds);

    cpus = cpu_usage;
}

void printCpuAndMemoryInfo(){
    double vm, rss, cpus;
    resource_usage(vm, rss, cpus);
    
    printf("Virtual Memory: %.lf", vm);
    printf("Resident set size:: %.lf", rss);
    printf("CPUs:: %.1lf(%)", cpus);
}
```
